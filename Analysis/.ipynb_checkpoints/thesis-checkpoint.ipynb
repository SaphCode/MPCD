    "Multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD), also known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD)[@winkl2009] is a technique originally introduced to study the dynamics of complex fluids such as polymers in solution. Besides MPCD, there exist other mesoscopic models that have been constructed for this purpose, such as Langevin, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and lattice Boltzmann methods.[@malev1999] We only concern ourselves with the application of MPCD, it follows that any comparison between methods are out of the scope of this thesis.\n",

The system is divided up into cells that have no restriction on the number of particles, each of the cells is part of a regular lattice. The dynamics is split into two parts: Particle streaming and multiparticle collision dynamics. Particle streaming is treated exactly for each particle in the system, while the collision step is approximated on a cell level. The multiparticle collision dynamics conserves mass, momentum and energy and leads to the correct hydrodynamical equations.[@malev1999] The streaming and collision step are described in more detail in (TODO: section numbering)."

When a particle hits the wall, it goes back the same way it came there, which means that the sign of the velocity vector is flipped. Stick boundary conditions are shown in figure.

This partial blocking by the wall causes the cell to have, on average, less particles than it would have, had the grid not been shifted. The change in average particles distorts the collision step of particles near the wall. For more complex geometries than the one used in this thesis, the wall wont even be parallel to the grid lines, which makes this a problem even without a grid shift. To compensate this, it has been shown in (TODO: find a source) that the following process undoes the distortion.\n",

Jumping to the second cell, we introduce 2 \"virtual particles\". In general, $\\bar N_c - N_c$ particles are introduced, where $\\bar N_c$ is the average number of particles per cell, chosen to be an integer, and $N_c$ is the actual number of particles found in cell $c$. Their velocities are sampled from two independent normal distributions with mean $\\mu = 0$ and variation $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{k_{B}T}{m}$, where $k_{B}$ is the boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the fluid, and $m$ is the mass of one particle."

In the end, the streaming and collision step are now performed in parallel, with the performance of the latter being very satisfying. The performance of the streaming step however could not be optimized much further. The problem is storage shared between threads, which means, to prevent errors and undefinable behavior, the program can't make full use of parallelization. It was tried to split this shared storage and later recombine, but this was to no avail. Ultimately, a lot of time was spent on this but unfortunately, the intricacies of C++ made this seem impossible.\n",
