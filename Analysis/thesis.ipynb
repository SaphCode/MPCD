Besides MPCD, there exist other mesoscopic models that have been constructed for this purpose, such as Langevin, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and lattice Boltzmann methods.[@malev1999] We only concern ourselves with the application of MPCD, it follows that any comparison between methods are out of the scope of this thesis.\n",

The system is divided up into cells that have no restriction on the number of particles, each of the cells is part of a regular lattice. The dynamics is split into two parts: Particle streaming and multiparticle collision dynamics. Particle streaming is treated exactly for each particle in the system, while the collision step is approximated on a cell level. The multiparticle collision dynamics conserves mass, momentum and energy and leads to the correct hydrodynamical equations.[@malev1999] The streaming and collision step are described in more detail in (TODO)."
