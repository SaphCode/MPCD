# To my dear supervisors

Dear Professor Likos!
Dear Dr. Bianchi!
Dear Professor Kahl!

I want to thank Professor Kahl for taking over the duty of supervising my bachelor's thesis. I'm very relieved that (hopefully) the administrative part has been taken care of. Dr. Bianchi, thank you very much again for organising everything.

A quick recap: This is the format I've chosen to report my progress. I'll periodically send a report that is generated by jupyter notebook (a science & analysis environment for python). The notebook is here for writing part of my thesis, as well as analyzing the data. The code is written in C++. So please don't worry if not everything looks good yet - the formatting, and improving the citation style as well as other things will be done later, when the bachelor's has mostly been finished.

Last time I implemented the streaming step and did some work on random generators, as well as finding my way into C++ again. It has been quite some time and I'm happy to report some progress.

This time the MPCD barebones should be completely working (streaming + collision + gridshift). Work was done on parallelizing the code (far too much), but this has been scrapped for now. Additionally, I've written a lot of analyzing code in python that will be there to generate some hopefully interesting plots once everything has been implemented. The code was tested, in my opinion, quite a lot, and I think there should be no issues. But if you find anything that looks suspicious from this report, just tell me right away.

Please stay in good health. Yours,

Chris

# MPCD simulation of polymers in solution

This notebook will serve as the documentation of our efforts and results for my Bachelor's Thesis. The goal of this thesis will be the study of short/long-chained polymers in a liquid thats flowing around obstacles. The liquid will be simulated with MPCD, or "Multi Particle Collision Dynamics".

I chose the language C++ for its familiar object-oriented nature and its proven execution-time. Output of the simulation will mostly be analysed in Python, specifically with Jupyter Notebook for a blend of beautiful visualizations and convenience. For simplification, the situation will be studied in 2D. The situation we specifically discussed is shown below.

![Situation](Assets/MPCD_Situation.png)

# Discussed questions

Are there other people I can contact for the programming/implementation details? - _Max Liebetreu, Andreas Zöddl_

How do I model the obstacles?, the walls? = the same? Many particles, large molecules? circles? - _Stick boundary conditions: velocity gets flipped when colliding. Also: virtual particles for cell partially filled by wall. Interaction with cylindrical obstacles is explained in Arash's paper._

How should I initialize the velocities? How large can they be without distorting the simulation? - _Maxwell Boltzmann with $2/2 k_B T$ (2D)_

If particles drift too far out of bounds, should they be destroyed, and should then new ones be created to keep the number constant? In other words, should there be a particle source? - _Yes. The situation is now fixed from 100 - 400 : 20 - 50 aspect ratio. When particles go out of those bounds, they are "teleported" to the other side. This means that it loops around, as if it was a ring, instead of a 2d pipe._

How can I test if my simulation is right? See if some parameter can be tuned to one of an experiment? How should we go about this? - _See if we get parabolic velocity profile for the 2d situation, after walls have been added. Also check conservation of energy._

Will we go to 3D? - _For the Bachelor's, we will keep it 2D._

# Open Questions

On what order should $D >> d$ in the drawing be? (see above) - _Still open._

Half discussed: How large can the timestep be? - _The timestep will be a function of the other parameters. In Arash's paper, a unit of time $\tau = \sqrt{\frac{m a^2}{k_B T}}$ was chosen and from this somehow a timestep was derived. For now, I'll take the same unit of time and make the MPCD timestep 1/10 of that (just like Arash)._ - Is that okay?

How should I choose the units, e.g. mass, Temperature? (In Arash's paper f.ex., T=1 was chosen) At the time I'm working with the mass of H2O[kg] and Body Temperature[K]. - _Still open._


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation

Does the equation for pressure difference hold?

In standard fluid-kinetics notation:[5][6][7]

{\displaystyle \Delta p={\frac {8\mu LQ}{\pi R^{4}}}={\frac {8\pi \mu LQ}{A^{2}}}}{\displaystyle \Delta p={\frac {8\mu LQ}{\pi R^{4}}}={\frac {8\pi \mu LQ}{A^{2}}}}
where:

The ratio of length to radius of a pipe should be greater than one forty-eighth of the Reynolds number for the Hagen–Poiseuille law to be valid.[9] If the pipe is too short, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation may result in unphysically high flow rates; the flow is bounded by Bernoulli's principle, under less restrictive conditions, by

{\displaystyle \Delta p={\frac {1}{2}}\rho v_{\text{max}}^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \left({\frac {Q_{\max }{}}{\pi R^{2}}}\right)^{2}\,\,\,\rightarrow \,\,\,Q_{\max }{}=\pi R^{2}{\sqrt {\frac {2\Delta p}{\rho }}},}{\displaystyle \Delta p={\frac {1}{2}}\rho v_{\text{max}}^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho \left({\frac {Q_{\max }{}}{\pi R^{2}}}\right)^{2}\,\,\,\rightarrow \,\,\,Q_{\max }{}=\pi R^{2}{\sqrt {\frac {2\Delta p}{\rho }}},}
because it's impossible to have less-than-zero (absolute) pressure (not to be confused with gauge pressure) in an incompressible flow.

# Next Steps

1. _Check the conservation of energy, momentum, do the grid shift or the wall + particles + obstacles shift. - _Done.__
2. Constant Force that pull the particles in +x direction + Gamma cell level thermostat
3. Implement Wall logic, check if we get a parabolic flow profile.
4. Implement obstacle logic.
5. Polymers MD?

# Introduction

Multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD), also known as Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD)[@winkl2009] is a technique originally introduced to study the dynamics of complex fluids such as polymers in solution. Besides MPCD, there exist other mesoscopic models that have been constructed for this purpose, such as Langevin, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and lattice Boltzmann methods.[@malev1999] We only concern ourselves with the application of MPCD, it follows that any comparison between methods are out of the scope of this thesis.

The MPCD technique models the fluid using particles, their positions and velocities are treated as continuous variables. The system is divided up into cells that have no restriction on the number of particles, each of the cells is part of a regular lattice. The dynamics is split into two parts: Particle streaming and multiparticle collision dynamics. Particle streaming is treated exactly for each particle in the system, while the collision step is approximated on a cell level. The multiparticle collision dynamics conserves mass, momentum and energy and leads to the correct hydrodynamical equations.[@malev1999] The streaming and collision step are described in more detail in (TODO: section numbering).

# The MPCD algorithm

The system we are modelling consists of $N$ particles with mass $m$, continuous position $\vec{r_{i}}$ and velocity $\vec{v_{i}}$, where $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$. One timestep $\Delta t$ shall correspond to having calculated all the new particle positions and velocities in the streaming and collision steps, respectively. For each of the $N$ particles, the streaming and collision steps are applied, and this pattern is repeated until the wanted number of timesteps have elapsed.

## The streaming step

The streaming step is very straightforward. The particle positions are simply updated according to

\begin{equation}
\vect{r_{i}} \rightarrow \vect{r_{i}} + \Delta t \cdot \vect{v_{i}}\textrm{,}
\end{equation}

where $\Delta t$ is a small time interval.[@winkl2009][@malev1999]

## The collision step

The collision step is somewhat more complicated. It involves the mean velocity of all particles in a particular cell, $\vect{V_c}$, the velocity of the particle $i$, $\vec{v_i}$, and a rotation matrix $\matr{R}(\alpha)$. The vector $\vect{v_i}$ is rotated relative to the mean velocity $\vect{V_c}$ of all particles in cell $c$, cell $c$ being the cell which particle $i$ belongs to. It is shown in [@malev1999] that the rule,

\begin{equation}
\vect{v_i} \rightarrow \vect{V_c} + \matr{R}(\alpha) [\vect{v_i} - \vect{V_c}] \textrm{,}
\end{equation}

conserves mass, momentum and energy under the molecular chaos assumption[@malev1999][@winkl2009, molecular chaos, p.7]. The rotation matrix $\matr{R}(\alpha)$ is a simple 2d rotation matrix

\begin{equation}
R(\alpha) = 
\left[ \begin{array}{rr}
cos(\alpha) & -sin(\alpha) \\
sin(\alpha) & cos(\alpha) \\
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is sampled randomly on a per-cell basis. Furthermore, for each particle in the cell $\alpha$ flips its sign with probability $\frac{1}{2}$.[@winkl2009, (p.6)]
The mean velocity of a cell is defined as

\begin{equation}
\vect{V_c} = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{i=1}^{N_c} \vect{v_i} \textrm{,}
\end{equation}

where $N_c$ is the number of particles in cell c.[@malev1999]

The original MPCD algorithm was not Galilean invariant. The problem lay in the "molecular chaos" assumption, which means that particles involved in a collision have no memory of earlier encounters when colliding. This assumption is problematic when the mean free path 

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \Delta t \sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{m}}
\end{equation}

is small compared to the cell size $a$, since the same particles collide with each other repeatedly and thus build up correlations. When $\lambda \gg a$ Ihle and Kroll have shown that the molecular chaos assumption holds and the simulated results deviate from experimental ones only negligibly.[@ihlekroll2001, p.2][@winkl2009]

The solution to this problem is to shift all particles by the same random vector $s$ before the collision step. The components of $s$ are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution in the interval $[-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}]$. After the collision, the particles are shifted back by the same amount.[@ihlekroll2001]

# Additions to the original MPCD Algorithm

## Interaction of fluid particles with obstacles

The fluid flows through a pipe that will be setup somewhere between 100 to 400 width, and 20 - 50 height, as can be seen in figure (TODO: figure number). In SI units, we might imagine .. (TODO: expand this section). The pipe has two parallel walls, the fluid-wall interaction is modeled using stick (or no-slip) boundary conditions. (TODO: figure). When a particle hits the wall, it goes back the same way it came there, which means that the sign of the velocity vector is flipped. Stick boundary conditions are shown in figure. (TODO: figure numbering) The fluid interacts with obstacles, which are modeled exactly like the wall, with a small complication from the geometry. To simplify this problem, the approximate collision process found in [@nikoubashman2013] is used.

![Container of MPCD fluid, with obstacles](Assets/MPCD_Pipe.png)

![Reflection of particle from wall, stick boundary conditions](Assets/Wall_stick_boundary_conditions_reflection.png)

Because of the shifting of the grid before the collision step, the cells next to the walls might be partially blocked by the wall. This partial blocking by the wall causes the cell to have, on average, less particles than it would have, had the grid not been shifted. The change in average particles distorts the collision step of particles near the wall. For more complex geometries than the one used in this thesis, the wall wont even be parallel to the grid lines, which makes this a problem even without a grid shift. To compensate this, it has been shown in (TODO: find a source) that the following process undoes the distortion.

As is shown in figure (TODO: figure numbering), imagine a cell being blocked a little bit by the wall. Let's assume that the average number of particles per cell is 4. In the first cell, we count 3 particles. What is now done, is to introduce a "virtual" particle, which we might imagine as being behind the wall, though the position of it does not matter. Jumping to the second cell, we introduce 2 "virtual particles". In general, $\bar N_c - N_c$ particles are introduced, where $\bar N_c$ is the average number of particles per cell, chosen to be an integer, and $N_c$ is the actual number of particles found in cell $c$. Their velocities are sampled from two independent normal distributions with mean $\mu = 0$ and variation $\sigma^2 = \frac{k_{B}T}{m}$, where $k_{B}$ is the boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the fluid, and $m$ is the mass of one particle.

![Undoing the distortion caused by the grid shift](Assets/Wall_stick_boundary_conditions_virtual_particles.png)

## The ballistics step

The ballistics step might be called a substep of particle streaming. After the particles are moved, their position is checked for interaction with the wall or obstacles. If particles overshoot the bounds set by either the wall or obstacles, their position is set to the collision point, their velocity is reversed, subsequently they are moved for the rest of the distance they would have travelled, as explained in section. (TODO: section numbering) This means we are assuming elastic collision between the particles, the walls and obstacles.

## Constant Force

Several methods exist to model poseuille flow. Here, a gravitational approach is chosen. This means an external force acts on the unit volume of the fluid, which is given by,

\begin{equation}
\vect{F} = \rho_S g \hat x,
\end{equation}

where $\rho_S$ is the mass density of the solvent, $g$ is the acceleration constant and $\hat x$ is the unit vector in the $x$-direction. This force is incorporated into the simulation by updating the position and velocity of a particle according to the solution for constant force Newton's equations.[@nikoubashman2013]

Because now a force acts on the particles, as seen in figure (TODO figure#), additional energy is coming into the system which needs to be controlled. The tool to do this in MPCD is called a thermostat.

![Increasing energy of system. Difference in energy at timestep t vs. t=0](Release/Assets/increasing_energy.png)

## Thermostat

To counteract the heating up of the fluid by the constant force on every particle, a thermostat is needed. As described in Winkler[@winkl2009], the computationally efficient cell-level thermostat was used. For this, the macroscopic flow profile is needed. Fluid flow through the cross section of a pipe with parallel walls and interaction modeled by no-slip boundary condition is called poseuille flow, the macroscopic flow profile is known. It is calculated as,

\begin{equation}
u(r) = \frac{\Delta p}{4\eta L_x} (R^2 - r^2),
\end{equation}

where $u$ is the macroscopic velocity in the x-direction, $\Delta p$ is the difference in pressure from beginning to end of the pipe, $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $L_x$ is the length of the pipe, $R$ is the radius of the pipe and $r$ is the $y$-coordinate of the particle relative to the center of the pipe.[@wiki:poseuille_equation] The situation is displayed in figure (TODO: make a figure)

TODO:
The pressure difference is on the order of $\Delta p \sim g$, where g is the acceleration constant of the force.[@nikoubashman2013]
END TODO

TODO:
The dynamic viscosity of water at body temperature is about $\eta \sim 0.6947$. END TODO

# Implementing the MPCD Algorithm

## Random Number Generation

### Uniform random number generation

_This section was shortened considerably. The old version can still be found at the end of this report._

Sampling numbers from a uniform distribution is very important for MPCD. Even if we did not initialize positions randomly, but for example all at one point, arguing that after a sufficient amount of timesteps, the particles will spread out, the rotation angle still truly needs to be random, in a statistical sense.

To this end, the xoshiro256++, developed by Sebastian Vigna and David Blackman, was used. It is a fast algorithm that does well on a variety of statistical tests. The xoshiro256++ belongs to the Xoshiro algorithms, which are an extended variant of xorshift algorithms.[@vigna2019] Xoshiro stands for "Xor, Shift, Rotation" and xorshift stands for "Xor, Shift". The Xoshiro algorithms, additional to xor and bit-shift operations, incorporate bitrotation.[@unimi:xoshiro][@wiki:xorshift]

### Sampling from a normal distribution

To initialize the velocities of generated particles, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution must be used. In two, as well as in three dimensions, this is equivalent to the product of two, or three, independent normal distributions with mean $\mu = 0$ and variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{k_{B}T}{m}$, where $k_{B}$ is the boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the fluid, and $m$ is the mass of one particle. Thus, the velocities are sampled from normal distributions.[@wiki:maxwell_boltzmann]

For this purpose, the normal distribution of the C++ standard library was used, along with a Mersenne Twister number generator, which, although it has some shortcomings, will for all practical purposes suffice for the scope of this thesis. Although the Xoshiro is far superior to the Mersenne Twister algorithm[@vigna2019], to adapt it for this purpose did not seem worth the effort, because the difference in quality will not be visible.

## MPCD barebones algorithm

### The streaming step

_This section was shortened, since I think it does not deserve its own._

The streaming step was implemented and tested in an older version of this thesis.

### The collision step

To model the interaction of particles with each other, we implement the collision rules, as detailed in section (TODO: section numbering). To avoid some of the downfalls of the original algorithm, as detailed in section (TODO: section#), we implement a grid shift.

#### Grid shift

After particle streaming, the grid is shifted. The components of this shift, $\vect s$ are sampled from a uniform random distribution in the interval $[-\frac{a}{2},\frac{a}{2}]$. This step is necessary to restore Galilean invariance, which is violated when the molecular chaos assumption does not hold. This happens when simulating cold fluids or when using very small timesteps.[@ihlekroll2001]
The shift is undone at the end of the collision step, after the velocity of all particles has been updated.

If particles go out of the simulation bounds due to the grid shift, they reappear at the other end as described in section (TODO: section numbering). Because the wall will not align with the grid anymore, virtual particles as described in section (TODO: section numbering) have to be introduced.

#### Velocity updating

_TODO_
_Note: The floor is not rendering correctly at the moment, but it's a mistake that will be fixed in the final version._

The velocities of the particles update according to equation (TODO: numbering equ). To calculate the mean velocity $\vec{V_{c}}$ of cell $c$, first a way to assign each particle a cell has to be established. Let the indices of the cell be $(i, j)$. The position of a cell can then be calculated as $x_c = j \cdot a + s_x$ and $y_c = i \cdot a + s_y$, where $a$ is the lattice constant, $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of grid shift $\vect s$. So for the indices it follows,

\begin{equation}
i = floor{\frac{y - s_y}{a}}\\
j = floor{\frac{x - s_x}{a}},
\end{equation}
where $(x,y)$ refers to the components of the particle's position vector. With this method to determine the cells, the total cell velocities and numbers of particles in each cell are calculated to obtain the mean cell velocity. Using a uniform randomly sampled rotation angle $\alpha$ and rule (TODO: numbering equ), the particles' velocities are updated.

### Testing MPCD barebones

Having implemented the essential features of the MPCD algorithm, namely the streaming and collision steps, it is time for testing it to make sure it was implemented correctly. This section will present conservation tests and visual tests. Note that there are no walls and no obstacles, no forces and no thermostat, yet.

#### Timestep animation

To inspect and understand the behavior of our simulation, an animation was created. The fluid starts out in a random state, which means that the positions and velocities of the particles are initialized randomly.

The initial state, and the one after 100 timesteps, of region $x \in (200, 240)$, $y \in (0, 20)$ can be seen below (TODO figure#). 

__An explanation of the plots__: Top left is a quiver plot, where I plot the velocity vectors of cells at their position. Top right is streamplot, where this same data is used to visualize streaming, background work (interpolation, probably) done by python. Bottom left are the particles positions in a 2d plane. Bottom right is a heatmap of number of particles per cell (will be helpful when implementing walls, because it should be less there if we don't implement virtual particles)

_The animations were sent by mail. If you did not get them and would like to see them, you can access them here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ih11zkpzapvd7qm/AADgbdW_ejXumRROJbCgMxaUa?dl=0_

_The animations will probably be more interesting once force, thermostat & obstacles have been implemented, but it was a good way to check the behavior of the simulation against the intuition._

#### Conservation of number of particles

The number of particles is (just for convenience) plotted and it stays constant.



![Constant number of particles](Assets/number_particles.png)

#### Conservation of momentum

Because the angle of rotation in the collision step is chosen randomly, and the streaming step does not change momentum, in a large system momentum should be conserved. The velocities of particles were taken and added up. The base momentum is the initial momentum, the error (or variation) from this base is plotted below.

Error $\sim 10^{-5}$

#### Energy

The collision step of the MPCD algorithm conserves energy _locally_, which is to say on a cell level. [@winkl2009] The energy should also be conserved globally, since no force is acting upon the particles _yet_, the streaming and collision steps conserve energy, and the particle number remains the same.

To inspect this, the energy of every particle is added up. The base energy is the initial energy, the error (or variation from this base) is calculated and plotted below.

## (Pseudo) Random Number Generation

### Sampling from uniform distribution

One of the pillars of this thesis is the generation of random rotation angles for the rotation matrix needed in the collision step. This proved to be somewhat difficult. First, the standard algorithm of the C++ standard library was tried, but it didn't qualify because it performed poorly in comparison to the second and third algorithms tried, which are called "Mersenne Twister" and "xoshiro256++", respectively.[@wiki:mersennetwister][@cppreference:prng][@unimi:xoshiro]

The Mersenne Twister was implemented using the C++ standard library. The xoshiro256++ was implemented using Sebastian Vigna's code with some additions.[@unimi:xoshiro]

To compare algorithms, and also to make sure that the implementation of the xoshiro256++ is right, a $\chi^2$ test for discrete observations was used. The generated angles in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ were split into $k+1$ buckets, where $k$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the $\chi^2$ distribution. The test error

\begin{equation}
T = \sum_{b=1}^{k+1}{\frac{(N_o - E[N_b])^2}{E[N_b]}},
\end{equation}

where $E[N_b] = \frac{N}{b}, b \in \{1, 2, \dots , k+1\}$ is the expected bucket size, is compared to $\chi^2_{1-\alpha, k}$, where $\alpha$ is the signifigance level. The null hypothesis

$$
H_0: \textrm{The angles are distributed uniformly in the interval } [0, 2 \pi)
$$

is tested against the alternative hypothesis

$$
H_1: \textrm{The angles are not distributed uniformly in the interval } [0, 2 \pi) \textrm{.}
$$

If the test should have significance level $\alpha$, $H_0$ is rejected if $T \ge \chi^2_{1-\alpha, k}$.[@fruehwirthstat][@wiki:chisquaredtest][@wiki:goodnessoffit]

The results of the $\chi^2$ test are summarised in [TODO: Table, and table formatting].

\end{table}



As we can see, both generators pass the $\chi^2$ test and we do not have to reject our null hypothesis $H_0$.

Visually, we can examine the generated buckets of both random generators in [TODO] the following plot. 



![A histogram of different bucket sizes generated by MT and xoshiro256++](Assets/angle_buckets.png)

The Mersenne Twister has been known to fail certain statistical tests since its inception, by virtue of its mathematical characteristics. There exist other algorithms that are designed to be faster and that do not fail any known statistical tests, examples of which are almost all of the algorithms in the xoshiro family.[@vigna2019] Ultimately, the xoshiro256++, developed by Sebastian Vigna and David Blackman, was used. It is a variant of the xorshift algorithm, which extends the bit-shift and xor methods by bitrotation, making it still very fast, and more "random" than the xorshift.[@wiki:xorshift][@unimi:xoshiro]

Note that testing a (pseudo) random number generator is usually much more involved than this, but since this has already been done extensively by other authors, we are satisfied with the $\chi^2$ test, simply to test the implementation of the xoshiro256++, since it plays an important part.[@wiki:prng][@vigna2019]

## Grid

For the implementation of the collision step, a regular lattice is needed.[@winkl2009] This grid has lattice constant $a$, which in this thesis will simply be $1$. Each cell of the grid has an average number of particles per cell, which is typically initialised to between three and 20, although it can be as high as 70[@ihlekroll2001]. This number mainly affects the viscosity of the fluid.(TODO: find source) The average number of particles for the studied situation is $\bar N_c = 10$.

TODO: update situation



![Average number of particles per Grid cell](Assets/average_grid_particles.png)

## The streaming step

The particle positions were drawn from a uniform real distribution in the same interval as the dimensions of the pipe. The velocities were sampled from a normal distribution as described in section (TODO: section number) The results can be seen in figure [TODO: figure numbering] below. From the positions in the first row, the velocities in the second row, particle streaming is applied for 1 and 10 timesteps, according to equation (TODO: equ numbering).

TODO: update situation



![Particle streaming without collision with MT and with xoshiro](Assets/particle_streaming.png)

We see the x and y coordinates are randomly initialized according to the shape of the container. Looking closely, one can see that our particles look very much like noise. The absolute value of the velocity components are initialized to at most 1% of their respective dimensions. After one timestep, some of the particles on the outer ranges have moved out of bounds, and after ten timesteps, the particles have thinned out considerably along the edges.

## Optimizing the algorithm

To optimize the runtime of the simulation, the code was analyzed for CPU & memory usage. Several areas were identified that needed improvement. In the end, the streaming and collision step are now performed in parallel, with the performance of the latter being very satisfying. The performance of the streaming step however could not be optimized much further. The problem is storage shared between threads, which means, to prevent errors and undefinable behavior, the program can't make full use of parallelization. It was tried to split this shared storage and later recombine, but this was to no avail. Ultimately, a lot of time was spent on this but unfortunately, the intricacies of C++ made this seem impossible.

The reason a lot of time was spent on this particular step is to make possible a larger simulation, i.e. larger number of particles.

<!--

CONSIDER THIS. SHOULD BECOME MAXWELL WHEN IMPLEMENTING COLLISION STEP TOO
After having implemented the streaming step and that other one: after time driftting, looks like this: (+velocity distribution = maxwell?)
